With Daniel taking over the tech team, and that coinciding with other sea changes in the technical work at the IJF, I've been considering what I want to do here. 

In short, since September 2021 I've been involved in the work of collecting, processing and storing the data for our databases. I built it the first time around, then rebuilt it better. It seems that through 2024 we will add two or so more. Then hopefully nothing for a while. 

The pipeline was a major vision of mine, and a precursor to the IJF's current success. At this point it's clear that the pipeline set the stage for Daniel's arrival, and what is currently a project he owns, standardization.

Developing the pipeline made me a much better programmer. It was also the only thing I did for 18 months or so. The work we've prognosticated for 2025 doesn't have a clear demand for me in particular. There are plenty of things I'd be involved in, but none clearly mine as the pipeline was.

I have new interest in the *research* work we should always have been doing: better methodologies, technical reports, whitepapers, maybe even open-sourcing etc. I'd like to work more closely with some reporters, but more than that, the academics, developing my other half, the analytic. This has been much discussed in recent weeks, originating in my interest in the MI program (see 2024-07-03 — Master and Commander, 2024-07-10 — Setting things down).

My excitement therefor is justified, as my first 2.75 years here were technical-only. However, for me to continue growing here, I need a clear technical remit. I did the pipeline — what's next?

There's lots of technical work planned for 2025, but it's more front-end and full-stack: new pages/products, visualisations, etc. 

It appears that the longtime next candidate for my attention, standardization, is actually a grassroots documentation effort than a technical problem. I can't afford to buy out of that, but what novel programming am I doing to assist the effort? If anything, I can try to take more ownership of standardization to fulfil my *research* interests. The other running train is OCR and vectorization. I want interoperability with this work, and conversational comfort with ML in general, but ML is not programming. This shows the landscape I approach has many half measures, areas of my required participation but not for my flourishing.

Let it then be said: I need to do some new programming. Perhaps stating the problem so clearly, as so, is most important for now. I want to sketch some areas of technical work I feel I could own:

- Graph database
- Search platform

My hesitation to both of these is that they are mutually exclusive and both overlap substantially with Postgres. More than that, both run into the vector territory, and I don’t think I can get into that. 

- API
- Open-source tools (e.g. https://github.com/washingtonpost/FastFEC, https://github.com/freedmand/semantra)
- Lipad
- reaching into procurement, OBD docs

Put another way: I was the man needed to build the collection infrastructure. Now, we can finally use the data we've collected. Are the only improvements the domain of machine learning? What do I offer now?

I think there’s plenty of work for me if I specialise in topics. I could get deeply into sector groupings etc. But I spent all this time learning software development. What for? 

I’m finding it hard to turn away from this entry for the night. I’m forcing the question that’s always lingered, which is what programming am I good at, and can I escape machine learning? I don’t think I could take my current programming skills into the job market and be happy. I think I need more. At the same time, I don’t know what more I should get for expediency, what more I’d like to get out of interest, and what more would be good to get for my work at the IJF.

This is a seriously difficult question. I didn’t pick the work of scraping and cleaning that I’ve been doing for years now. I just got a job and I did this instead of visualisation or whatever else I was doing at the time.

Fortunately, I feel stable and more than just time, I have plenty of the research work that really will construct something of me. During that time, I hope to clarify my interests and close in on these questions. In particular, if I work with the academics more, I hope my intuitions about ML — its difficulty and banality — are tested.

I’m within view of a respectable project that I started about three years ago. Future developments I either assumed to never see happen or to take over myself have fallen either as non-technical, to Daniel’s initiative, or to Will et al’s expertise. I need to decide what I do. But I can afford to think about it while the research side catches up.
