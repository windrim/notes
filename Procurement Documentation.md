Lots of work today on this. Met with Meghan and showed her the [draft of the report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_rvdxi4F-GxjWp4sd9ydnIB2etswGLfj1YDaodHTOGA/edit). We resolved I should go to academics to seek their advice on [documentation standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ixYl_ay9i5gCUJD7n4p0ql15-QZsaRNLOPb3kiq6Xk0/edit).

I'm realising the IJF has no standard as to when we've understood a database. But whatever a good standard is, we're not there with any of our products. For example, PSPC has all [these materials](https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/how-procurement-works) about procurement we never read.

This could represent my overture to the academics people. I'm being aggressive here, competing for territory after I've lost the technical battle on standardization to Daniel's tooling and Will's DS expertise. There's still room for me there in research and expertise. But the technical place is unclear (see [[The Future of Work]]).
